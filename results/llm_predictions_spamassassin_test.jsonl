On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran\nch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

People will go to \n> see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to \n> express their malice and discontent towards not only the present \n> regime in America, but also the corrupt, empty, shallow pantomime \n> which cast them into power.\n>\n> In reality, today the voting that takes place via the act of \n> consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth \n> and dimpling the appropriate chad, or some other such convoluted act \n> of free democratic expression.\n>\n> Why?  Because in America, they believe in dollars.  Dollars don't lie. \n>  In practise, they are the last frontier of truth in America, \n> universally accepted as expressions of fear, desire, passion, and \n> need.  Compared to the swing of the almighty buck, and Jeb Bush knows \n> this, a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning.\n>\n> Given that fact, I modestly propose an entirely new, though wholly \n> logical, extension to the current democratic system in place in \n> America:\n>\n> I propose we augment, and effectively replace, the electoral system \n> with a political stock market.  We should accept that Politicians are \n> entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in America, and \n> embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects \n> their intent.  A politician should issue a constant number of shares \n> dependent upon his tenure in government.  Those shares should be \n> traded on an open exchange, say the G.R.E.E.D. (short, of course, for \n> the \"Global Realists' Electoral Exchange -- Democratic\").  Politicians \n> we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their \n> ability to maintain office grows.  As the truth about their embezzling \n> campaign funds for weekend trips to Maui with their interns is \n> revealed, of course, their fortunes will fall.\n>\n> This represents an opportunity for the market forces -- those same \n> forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal \n> protest -- to voice their opinion on the quality of America's \n> governance during the intervening four years between elections.  \n> Elections themselves will in effect become meaningless, as they are \n> now, since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each \n> and every congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.\n>\n> Just think of the coverage that could be given on MSNBC!  \"Strom \n> Thurman (STROM: news - quotes) was down 15% today on fears that his \n> latest heart operation will render him unable to attend Senate Armed \n> Services committee meetings until November..\"  This would provide \n> rejuvenating content to the econo-political news sector, which has \n> found post-economic-bubble coverage to be both tiresome and \n> deoressing.  The establishment of this new stock exchange would of \n> course create jobs for newly unemployed (and governmentally retrained) \n> IT systems engineers who could, after passing the electoral securities \n> exam, become floor traders.\n>\n> This would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which \n> candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their \n> multi-billion-dollar campaigns.  The requirement for the support of \n> legions of spin doctors, permanent campaign managers, and investor \n> relations personnel would also create jobs -- perhaps even a new \n> practice for Ernst & Young, Arthur Anderson, et al.  Insider trading \n> scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch \n> Martha Stewart as an unwitting beneficiary, thus spreading her \n> influence to politics.\n>\n> Dividends, if there are any on record, at the close of a politician's \n> career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings.  \n> Pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support \n> necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the Beltway set.  \n> Union funds, brokerages, and even pump-and-dump houses could benefit \n> from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the \n> Southeast, and the Bush Governmet would be allowed to place Social \n> Security bets where they really mattered.   investors who lose their \n> retirement, life savings, and support could rest assured that they \n> were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors.\n>\n> Although there's no way to protect any of these for Worldcom-like \n> crashes, ambitious, inspired, District Attorneys could file criminal \n> suits against Candidates and Campaign Managers who underperform \n> expectations, thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty \n> -- instead, they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves.\n>\n> On the whole, I believe the system could work.  I could certainly work \n> as well as our beloved securities trading industry and, given the \n> American electoral system's success at effectively expressing the will \n> of the people, it certainly couldn't do any worse...\n>\n> In the meantime, Mike, I think I'll go see your movie and try to \n> depose the President.\n>\n> -Ian.\n>\n>\n>\n> On Wednesday, October 9, 2002, at 03:53 PM, Michael Moore's Mailing \n> List wrote:\n>\n>> October 9, 2002\n>>\n>> My Film, \"Bowling for Columbine,\" Opens This Friday\n>>\n>> Dear friends, fans, and fellow evildoers:\n>>\n>> I am very happy and excited to tell you that this Friday, October 11, \n>> my\n>> new\n>> film, \"Bowling for Columbine,\" will open in New York and Los Angeles.\n>>\n>> It is, I promise, the last thing the Bushies want projected on the \n>> movie\n>> screens across America this week.

This was a really bad argument \nagainst using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that \nthey \na) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some \nsort of autodetection and changing crap)\nb) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because \nformats have changed.\n\nRed Hat is not \"taking it easy\" on this, it's putting control in the hands \nof you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.\n\n> Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my\n> laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is\n> dumb because they are already compressed.

You did put \n/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use \nthe same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the \ndata as is.\n\nIf you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need \nto make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup \nand rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over \nssh.  It's the best way to make backups.\n\n> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! \n\nIt's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they \ncame from ;)\n\nGood luck,\nThomas\n-- \n\nThe Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/\n<-*-                      -*->\nYou know the shape my breath will take before I let it out\n<-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*->\nURGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list", "label": 1, "pred_label": "/", "pred_label_int": 0, "rationale": "/\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list/\nhttp://lists.freshrpms"}

Unlike competing solutions that \n> process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes \n> the data in \n> hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater \n> performance, \n> according to company officials.\n> \n> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the \n> first in a \n> family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based \n> startup. The \n> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n> data.\n> \n> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data \n> between two \n> businesses.\n> \n> \"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n> \"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n> \n> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the \n> file size up \n> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n> alternative.\n> \n> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n> importance in the world of XML.\n> \n> \"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n> said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n> Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n> \n> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n> \n> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach \n> the company \n> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with \n> regards to speed \n> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n> \n> \"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that \n> he believes \n> will be mostly false.\n> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes \n> of a packet, \n> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at \n> 1,400 bytes \n> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n> \n> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \n> collection of \n> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \n> markup language \n> as they pass through the device.\n> \n> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and \n> will identify \n> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n> \n> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an \n> application \n> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators \n> more granular \n> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n> controls the device.\n> \n> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging \n> market. Startup \n> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega \n> XPE switch in \n> May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, \n> launched with a \n> focus on content processing and acceleration.\n> The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at \n> $54,995.

I was trying to\nfigure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the\n\"--with\" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using\n\"--define\". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's\nback, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email\nit to the list for further criticism :)\n\nAs far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If\nyou're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,\nit's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently\ndo).\n\nAlso, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch \nto compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other \npeople seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?\n\ngary\n\nP.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages!

These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported\n   to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don't think the\n   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,\n   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.\n\n2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects\n   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA\n   tuning and development.\n\n3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off\n   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology\n   (by both spammers and non-spammers).\n\nThe second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa\nsignature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used\nby SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or\nSHA-1 of each file).\n\nThe third problem doesn't really worry me.\n\nThese problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique\nto spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related\ncorpuses have their own set of problems, of course.\n\nIn other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having\nmultiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute\ntesting and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution\n(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If\nyou're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus\nof 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that\nmuch work.

If we ever get\naround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\ntransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's\ngovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\ninnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\nsummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\nthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\n\nThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n\"terminal\" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\nbest school possible.\n\nWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\nfor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,\nask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\nyears for proof.\n\nMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\nWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,\nChicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who\ngoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\nafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\ncouldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\nlast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\nand \"biased\" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\n\nThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with \"terminal\"\ndegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\nlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\nbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\ndeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\nwho don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\nsmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\nBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\nrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to\nbeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\nwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\nMissouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,\nmuch less a \"terminal\" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on\nthis list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with\neducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The\nfacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.\nThere are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and\neconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including\nignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,\nintelligence and effort.\n\n[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of\ncompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,\napparently.]\n\n\n\nBTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\nall those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\nthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\nmost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\nall of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\nnot \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\nThat efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\nPeople's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\nstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\napparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd\nknow about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase\nin general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about\nextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\ndoesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\npolitician as Santa Claus come election time...\n\n\nIn short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\ntheft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and\nredistributionist labor \"theory\" of value happy horseshit is just\nthat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n\nTo believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\nwrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuR\nYYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu\n=z877\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
