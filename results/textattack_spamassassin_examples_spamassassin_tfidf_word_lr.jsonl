And many peoples (e.g. American\nIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth\nin popular culture.\n\nI'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where\nyou are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you\nhave a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal\npopulation, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com"}

An exploited system, to whatever extent, places\nother corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company\nreputation and liability with customers at risk, and\nproprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably\nexpected to use Outlook in a safe manner.
