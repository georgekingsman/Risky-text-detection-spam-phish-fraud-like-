Moller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International 
    has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal 
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen. 

    You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded 
    some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, 
    this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost 
    effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have 
    come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar.

I've just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the 'proper' way to pass it through there, systemwide, before accepting it and sending it to the users.  It's kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user, when the user's home directories are NFS mounted....and the source is on my own machine, on which I try new things.

I've not used Spamassassin on the KISS principle. I just have procmail
adding an X-header and optionally modifying the Subject if razor-check
comes back positive.

I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my ""sh"".

(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't
need special quoting.)

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!</p>

"Here is my recipe for Maildrop:

# Vipul's Razor check
#
log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE""

{
  xfilter ""reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'""
  log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""

}

I used this with Razor version 1.  I'm not sure if it was ever used
with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to
remove the log statements once running.

I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
very good job.

I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.
I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).
Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,

Did I claim ""all gay people are hyperpromiscuous""? For what this is worth,
I would claim they're considerably more promiscuous on the average than
your average het. My utterly unscientific, unsubstatiated claim is that
the typical male would *like* to be considerably more promiscous than your
average female (ay, and here's the rub. pray don't forget the kleenex).  
Look up different reproduction strategies, due to basic hardware
difference (sexual dimorphism). You'd do that too if it happened to you.

Once you go past the first three of four pages of hysterical propaganda on
Google you might actually run into real studies. Anyone game? I have to 
work (well, pretend to).

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  

For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

RAH

I don't think so: it should be getting a stream of PS from stdin,
but it's not. The printing/spooling system is executing gs but
somehow failing to provide it with input.

That might clarify that the later part of the system works, but I
suspect the problem is earlier.

Odd. Did I certify that one? What's the 7-digit IBM model number, and

Hash: SHA1

I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd
suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is
showing up, right?


Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust
out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,
as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a
real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:
""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the
Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians
would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...)

But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,
lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and
an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe
or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist
congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist
bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I
used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.
I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I
show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a
civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing
with them. :-).


Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.
I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one
year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married
her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was
just looking to make friends as I was new in town.


The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation
you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some
guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can
practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a
room...

That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most
regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in
protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,
looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.
You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at
least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there
are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics
- -- but I won't go there, I promise.


If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure
that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's
religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of
assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near
you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I
did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

Cheers,
RAH

Anybody is free to develop their own Java VM and make it kick ass. As
someone said earlier in the thread, nobody is capable or willing to do that.

AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks

If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, ""the No.
1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
[New York's] Upper East Side.

""It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store""
on Madison Avenue, which features ""rich vulnerable women,"" the mag's
October issue says.

AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
place published, or being cited as the ""in"" place for finding loaded women
- or rather, women who are loaded.

""The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!"" an AA
spokesman told The Post.

O.K.

The associated links cover that: The surface temperature in spots
frequented by people is warmer (hence all our groundbased sensors
reporting global warming) although the overall environmental
temperature is decreasing.

Apparently, the real news is not that there is no global warming, but
that our models of the warming were seriously flawed by naive
convection models.  This too was not news to the theoreticians: All
that has happened is that NASA has confirmed the naiive convection
concerns.

So did my build if the original source is what you were mentioning ;-)
One drawback : They changed from pspell to aspell apparently, and it
requires aspell >= 0.50 which isn't even in Rawhide, so spell checking is
disabled for now until I take a decision about it :-/

If I build recent aspell packages, they may not be upgraded when ungrating
to the next Red Hat Linux release (the final version of the limbos and
(null) betas), which is maybe not really desired. I'll probably test and
see...

PS: The spec file was massively updated and the --with / --without options
that can be used to rebuild the source packages are now listed in the
description ;-)

OK - I've yet to dive into the latest round of changes, but I plan to.
I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.

This is in textSelection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste.
It is that last ""cutbuffer get"" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
just disable that - try this variant:

proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {

Everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.

Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.

I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on Friday, 
and have plenty of ""real work"" to do, I won't be able to do much until I get 
back.

I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check into 
what's slow and fix things while I'm gone, my feelings won't be hurt.

Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU
is probably working.

Pictish pictograms (still undeciphered)

I'd be interested in an update on the latest thinking on these things.
Particularly the 'swimming elephant' pictogram.

There's a book come out recently on the world's undeciphered scripts
(including Linear A and Etruscan).
Has any list member read it?

Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for
$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited
the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time
later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors
for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new
cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't
stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only
$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to
pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which
he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you
are making right now but these are the kinds of

Thanks for the input.  Some of the tips are quite portable but are there any

Sure.  But for most people, changing their company's or ISP's server
requires years of lobbying, while they have total and immediate

Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. 

And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.


Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. 

""But it's not, they are really out there."" 

'Cats with cubs' 

Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. 

Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. 

The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. 

But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. 

""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 

'Trigger camera' 

The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. 

But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. 

A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. 

Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself."" 

'Like dogs' 

The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. 

Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. 

""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo.""

As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.

Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.

In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.

"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)

My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.

Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's

IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

"Klez: The Virus That Won't Die
 
Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.

Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002


The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.

Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.

And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

Strange.
Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I
wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is
entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/

Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(

Why ""search""? There's more than enough to choose from here :

The military already have these spy satellites; they are basically
Hubble pointed the other way, so I doubt they will be a big enough
customer of this service to justify a next-generation wireless
network rollout for the rest of us.

My car is only just over 1.5 meters across and maybe 3 meters long, so
that means roughly six pixels total surface area.  You might find a
16-wheeler this way, but how often do people misplace a 16-wheeler
such that it is _that_ important to get old images of the terrain?
Since they can't send up aircraft to update images in realtime every
time, how is this different from just releasing the map on DVDs?  Why
wireless?

I thought of the common problem of lost prize cattle, but there again,
will there really be business-case for creating a hi-res map of
wyoming on the fly instead of just doing what they do now and hiring a
helicopter for a few hours?

I can see lower-res being useful for Geologists, but considering their
points of interest change only a few times every few million years,
there's not much need to be wireless based on up-to-the-minute data.
I expect most geologists travel with a laptop perfectly capable of DVD
playback, and I also expect the most interesting geology is in regions
where the wireless ain't going to go ;)

I don't mean to nit-pick, it's just that I'm curious as to (a) the
need for this product that justifies the extreme cost and (b) how we'd
justify the ubiquitous next-generation wireless network that this
product postulates when we /still/ can't find the killer app for 3G.

YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. 
BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERS MONEY TO 
 A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 
AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE
  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
PLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. 
YOURS FAITHFULLY,

Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is
trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:

  Using a database:
   real    8m24.741s
   user    6m19.410s
   sys     1m33.650s

  Using a pickle:
   real    1m39.824s
   user    1m36.400s
   sys     0m2.160s

This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).

For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:

   real    0m29.592s
   user    0m28.050s
   sys     0m1.180s

Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though.

I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  

On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.

Yes ;)

first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released 
version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they 
sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your 
own.

second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been 
changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release 
anyway"".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this 
from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

If you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;)

"2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -
byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a ""pattern - body""
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
correctly, and was arguably wrong before.

2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).

Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).

It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.

Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is
trivial.

Exactly -- ""let's you and him fight"" is a
way of dealing with troublesome populations
by moving them next to one another, so they
give each other, and not the Man, grief*.

So by my understanding (and, you all will
understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):

Ireland:  Irish?  Uppity barbarians overly
   fond of ""risings"".  Scots?  More uppity
   barbarians overly fond of ""risings"".
   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
   next to the former and kill two birds
   with one stone?

Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians
   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy
   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why
   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
   to the former and kill two birds with one
   stone?

but not:

India: in which the muslims and hindus were
    originally intermixed to some degree,
    but Partioned due to their own conflict,
    not due to English resettlement policy.

Canada: in which the french and english were
    already established, and it was just the
    balance of power on the continent that
    determined events in the colonies.  The
    Acadians got resettled, but they don't
    seem to have been that good for picking
    fights with their neighbors, so no one
    had them plonked down next door.

You choose to have your email client do that.  You don't have to.  Short
of Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including
reading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise.

An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  
If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the
line before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffer
sniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.

The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --
maybe -- Palladium.

That begged to try it again but with Tokenize/retain_pure_html_tags false.
The random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here,
and I repaired the bug that dropped 1 ham and 1 spam on the floor, so this
isn't exactly a 1-change difference between runs.

Yay!  That may mean that HTML tags aren't really needed in my test data

here is the same as the sole false positive on the half&half run reported in
the preceding msg (I assume the Nigerian scam ""false positive"" just happened
to end up in the training data both times):

This is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little 
while (in the background) to build the sequences window.  There is probably 
some tuning possible in this area.

I changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to 
a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen 
messages may be in.  I *did* ask Brent before I did it.  If you like the old 
behavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.

This is because of your Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen which is calling a function 
which no longer exists.

I suspect you need
	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid
now instead of 
	Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if
you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)

Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates.

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.

I see no reason why both approaches could and should not be used.
MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that 
would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the 
group of people using that MTA.   I'm sure that such an approach would 
significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without  giving  
false positives.

MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I'd like the 
option of 'down-loadable' corpuses and merge functionality.

Lennon killer seeks parole again

The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.

Interesting.  I just upgraded to razor-agents 2.14 yesterday, ran

Do you have a dialup or something more modern <wink>?  134MB of messages
zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB I'd guess with all
the similarity in the headers and such.  You could zip each of the 10 sets
individually and upload them somewhere.

How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a
number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing
script to help further cleanse it?  The ""problem"" with the ham is it tends
to be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the
spam.

I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls
over and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages.  Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use.  Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call that
an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  

Yours Faithfully,
Capt JOHN OKELE

I'll second that, although with emphasis

I do mind if someone should attempt to

You get _exactly_ the same problem with Suse and RedHat, is that right?

As in freezes, reboots?  Do you get any errors?

1. What laptop is it?  What is the Processor and how much RAM does it have?

2. You cannot simply boot off the cdrom?  It must be quite an old laptop
then or else cdrom booting is disabled in the BIOS.  Is the cdrom external
or strange in some way?

Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference 
between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use 
the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the 
problem.

Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

Which was my point. Gurls don't do hyperpromiscuity as a life style. It's

Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET

MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.

Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.

They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.

But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.

""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""",0,train,test

That has the nasty side effect of placing all .py files in the package.
What about obvious executable scripts (like timtest or hammie)?  How can I
keep them out of the package?

You could go the same way as the others and call it gkrellm2 and
conflict with v1 if the executables or paths are the same.

It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.

Got it?

Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)

I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
got around to making them spamtraps.

So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
the majority of them don't work.

If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
because again it's easy to trace you.

So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.

Everyone else doesn't really care.


That's my view anyway. :)

"Hello,

I'm new to the list.
I wanted to find out who tried recompiling a working apt rpm for (null) or 
psyche.  I would like to get good GStreamer packages done by monday when 
it's released.

BTW, in the archive I saw some posts regarding the GStreamer repository.  
I'm not sure why they were posted on this list ;) In any case, I'm the rpm 
maintainer, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I was trying to get an updated apt rpm from http://dave.cridland.net/, but 
the http port is closed.  Dave, if you're reading this, please let me know 
where I can get the updated rpm.

Thanks,
Thomas

"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at
part of the equation.

America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is
a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There
is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the
right time, to go that high.

Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is
involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.
Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.
Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.

Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the
rest of us who tend to sort.

There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the
first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree
at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits
of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.

And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity
of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most
people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better
if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the
Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'
is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.

Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far
more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.
Superior performance, often not.

Is Maximum System Performance and Reliablilty Important to you?

Find out what you are missing!

New Diskeeper Lite for Windows.

IT'S FREE!


* Includes the same advanced defragmentation technology used in
  Diskeeper 7.0.
* Is much faster than the previous Diskeeper Lite and all
  built-in defragmenters.
* Now runs on Windows NT/98/2000/XP.

Millions of downloads attest to the popularity of Diskeeper Lite,
but it only ran on Windows NT 4.0. Now it's been updated for all
Windows operating systems from Windows 98 onward.

New Diskeeper Lite is still manual-only and cannot be scheduled
or run across a network, but it is far superior to any built-in
defragmenter and much faster. And it will show you why full-version
Diskeeper is the most recommended automatic defragmenter ever
built.

Find out what you are really missing. Free!

they are on python 2.2 for 8.0 - but they don't like to break

therefore: 6.X was 1.5.2 b/c that was current
7.x was 1.5.2 b/c that was current when 7.0 was released.

Don't swallow too quickly what you have read about

we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from

Granting your first two points, I'm skeptical about

or the west generally are suffering from lack of
innovation, vis-a-vis youth nations such as Iran? The
last I read, the third generation of the revolution all

""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  

I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  

At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.

My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.

I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.

BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?

Thanks.

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores

Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
""We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,"" said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
""We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,"" she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.

I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.

A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.

Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

Sorry, that just can't work.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.

Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.

Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.

The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the
fact they were hired in the first place?

BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market
there were also gains to society from irrational behavior.

If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their
chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for
society.  On the social level, the law of averages works to societies
benefit in a manner it can't for an individual.

A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England
was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own
good.

(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals
and railroads over here.  Thanks, guys.)

"I knew it'd be a day for insanity.

so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that
ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that
originally linked) spanked.

Slashdot, of course, links to them.

So now, I link to slashdot.

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123

I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01
clues.  But that's wrong too!  It looks I haven't grokked this part of
your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the
classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,
and no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for
clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't
exactly 0.5?

> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!

This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few
similar ones.  I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking
at the clues and the HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in
the sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of ""OO and
soft coding"" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including
Zope and ZEO).

Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
progress there?

No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:

  multipart/mixed
      text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))
      text/html         (long HTML copied from website)

I guess you get this when you click on ""mail this page"" in some

I think it's still corpus size.

Sure thing :)

I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at
build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a

	rpmbuild --recompile <rpm> --without oss --without isapnp

(I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard
is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)).

Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package
installed.  I've added a flag ""kernsrc"", that also can be used
--without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It
would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
(/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm
a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file
not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way
to do that.

I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards
option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found
out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs 
don't help much.


Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of
alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply
the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules
from source.  It created the /dev files and all.

Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild
the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec:

rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp
--without kernsrc

But I get this:

========================================================================

Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand
much of what's going on here.  The 00macros file is from the MAKEDEV
rpm, and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsa-driver, I think.
   It is not in the filesystem, anyway.

I've looked in /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root, they are there in
etc.  For 00macros I think the part that does it is this line
in alsa-driver.spec:

cp -a %{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/00macros /{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/

And alsasound is installed by %{BUILDIDR}/Makefile.


Oh, and I think I've forgot to mention, I'm running beta-null :).

Why ""Eek""? :-)
If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/

My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.

3. usage of <p> just like <br> (ie. without </p>) which is obsolete

4. tag argument values sometimes enclosed in """", sometimes not
5. colour args without # in front of hex rgb code
6. colour args with non-6-digit rgb code (typo)
7. onMouseOver et al in nonconsistent case throughout the document

Mind, those are just ideas. I'm pretty sure some or even most of them
are not working in practice, but they might be worth checking out.

Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.

Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.

Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.

""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""

N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.

While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.

Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.",0,train,test

Heheheh... So becomming a university professor was your second career

Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had 
many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.

As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

IM client vulnerable to attack 
IM client vulnerable to attack 

James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  

Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.

Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.

Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.

According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.

David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.

""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it.""

He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece.""

""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.

Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.

Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).

And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.

"Related anecdote:

I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.

He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.

I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.

Anecdote number two:

In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.

I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who

This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
players.

Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.

Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
under any other guise.

Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
European way of doing things is beyond me.

The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 

For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
years.

I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.

First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.

Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?

In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
understand a word they are saying either.

Thanks to Jenny[1] for the pointer to this Yale Law article[2] about The 
Wayback Machine removing articles about Scientology. ""While Lawmeme doesn't 
know all the details of Scientology's request to the Internet Archive, 
especially the extent of websites removed, we do know that the Internet Archive 
is blocking all archived versions of one of Scientology's leading critics and 
the main target in the Google Affair, Xenu.net.""

Well, I've made an updated libsigc++ 1.0.4 package. It rebuilds cleanly on
7.3 but the *.so* libraries are missing when trying to rebuild on 8.0 (the
.a and .la files and everything else is though).
Do you have an idea of what the problem may be? Julian : Do you want the
.src.rpm to try to find the cause?

Forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job. I tracked them
down, they dont exist anymore, like 99% of the things I track down the req's

The real problem is you cant even train for jobs now, since they _demand_
7-10 years at a job paid to do the wierd collection of skills they want.

But I'll get lucky eventually and someone I know will be a hiring manager.

A terrible argument. There are better technical solutions to privacy

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals
very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.

One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.

If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead.  However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.

The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.

I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.

The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are.  Any ideas ?

Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.

In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.

Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.

It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.

That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse

the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served

If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.

Hm, it is built inside the same chroot.  aviplay works (well it would if I 
had XV, I get X errors ;)).  But it doesn't complain about linker 
problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok.

Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects - 
naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of 
libraries, API stability, ...

Ah!  The mixer stuff was what made me look for an init script in the
first place, I didn't bother to check whether the existing stuff would
have worked with that.  Will try that out, you can assume silence ==

Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].



    

    Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of 
    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.  

    [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. ""Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,"" said 
    a French military analyst. ""But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny."" 

    [...] ""Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"" 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. ""Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years.""

America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is

impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

But some plonker will come up with yet another computer model
predicting global warming and storms and floods in 50 years even
though it can't predict next week's weather.  And predict widespread
cooling in some parts of the globe (which is now part of global
""warming"").  And will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive
scaremong^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H proof.

Umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations, when
even detectable in the noise, go either way depending on which data
you look at.

One study from Vienna showed long-term warming from thermometers at
the airport, and none from other sites.  Another study with data from
Antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being
free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by
the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew

Razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere?   BTW, I notice all my *.conf

Yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated!   comparing text classifiers
like spam filters, without tracking FPs, is not good.   After all, ""cat >
/dev/null"" gets a 100% hit rate, but without the FP rate figure of, let's
say 90%, you'd never know it was a bad thing to do ;)

argh, they do not, do they?   the FPs must be just gigantic :(

Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.

Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.

Amavisd or Amavisd-new? If the latter, you don't need spamd running, since
amavisd-new calls SA functions directly.

The tacit acknowledgement and self-limiting you speak of is not a given
or a function of 'sophistication' but is primarily a feature of
(current) Western Civilization.  Of course, 'sophisticated' and 'Western
Civilization' are essentially equivalent IMHO.  But it need not be so.

And sometimes the religious component is a faade for an equally
dangerous ethnic affiliation.  Hindu extremism isn't about the Hindu
religious theology as far as I can see.  It is a peg to hang an ethnic
identity and identity politics on.

Muslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology.

Yep, all because the Scots ate oats and starved their Irish out long
ago, while the English preferred wheat and that doesn't grow so well in
Ireland.  That and the introduction of potatoes saved the Irish as
Irish.

Oh, I think we are in a war with wide aspects of the Muslim religion.  I
know it is there, but it just might not be appropriate to admit it
publicly.

I didn't say this was a *good* thing.  With the exception of ethnic
restaurants, I can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled
'multi-cultural'.

this article certainly looks impressive when paired together with this other

Just the concept makes me shudder, imagining how easy it must be to smuggle

"Hello all,
Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I
downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?

./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
make
At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
make: *** [w3] Error 2

When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
the commands I used.
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
followed by the commands make and make install.
There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.

Thanks again

"Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.
We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);
the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were:

    false positive percentages
        0.187
        0.749
        0.780
    total unique fp 19

    false negative percentages
        2.072
        2.448
        0.574
    total unique fn 43

The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run
fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.

Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about
600 ham and spam in each:

    false positive percentages
        0.000
        1.398
        1.398
        0.000
        1.242
        1.242
        1.398
        1.398
        0.000
        1.553
        1.553
        0.000
    total unique fp 139

    false negative percentages
       10.413
        6.104
        5.027
        8.259
        2.873
        5.745
        5.206
        4.488
        9.336
        5.206
        5.027
        9.874
    total unique fn 970

So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported
significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
those starting with 'x-vm').

When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I
see:

    false positive percentages
        0.000
        0.000
        0.200
        0.000
        0.200
        0.000
        0.200

This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.

It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",0,train,test

Perhaps /cannot be heard in any other way (period)/ was incorrect.

Sure.  And that goes back to my second argument -- Cohen.   THey can

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.

Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.

Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.

Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.

With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.

Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.

For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.",0,train,test

These are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here.  (Is that permitted? :)

I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.

What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.

I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.

"Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""",0,train,test

Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business
model. But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it
comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.

If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying
won't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is
whether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,
or just make sure that it isn't trivial.

A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be
more concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,
and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely
to view matters differently.

> Does it really make it more secure ?

Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same
is ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to
require resources other than just labour.

Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible
to ensure that doing so is uneconomical.

> Look at the DVDs.

IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and
one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.

As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans
who speak english at home and those who do not.  I don't have figures
that separate those at hand, though.

1989 American Indians (US Pop as a whole) -- Families below poverty

than English 23 (13.8) Married couple families 65.8 (79.5) Median family

Note: High Income countries in 1989 were defined as having over $6,000

Dan,

To answer your question to my post (which maybe should be a seperate bug?) I'm 
using Spamassassin version 2.30

"Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.

Best would be to have a button for ""Global sort and update all scan caches""
in the exmh More... menu

I'd like this (despite the additional installation burden - we can ship
binaries for Windows and Mac) and not only for technical reasons.  As I
understand it, post-1.8x versions of the core bsddb code ship under the
Sleepycat license, which demands that projects using it must be
published-source.  This is a problem if we want Spambayes to be fully
PSF-licensed - if someone wants to take the Spambayes source and fund their
addictions by creating a commercial, closed-source spam-filter product, the
PSF license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb.  Not that I'm
in favour of people making money from Spambayes (unless it's me 8-) but the
PSF license does allow for it - it should be all or nothing.  Or do I have
this all wrong?

Slightly OT: This has concerned me since PLabs announced that they were
integrating bsddb into Python 2.3 - it's going to make it very easy
(especially on Windows) for someone to write code that uses anydbm, wrap it
up with Py2exe and ship it under a commercial license, not knowing that
they're breaking the Sleepycat license.  They've never heard of Sleepycat
Software or even bsddb - as far as they're concerned, this ""bsddb.pyd"" file
that Py2exe tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python,
like _socket.pyd or select.pyd.
